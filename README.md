# FiveM-Boilerplate

### This is a boilerplate for FiveM Roleplay Server, it might help you to save a lot of time by skipping the development of the same boring stuff. 

> I developed a server but I do not have the time to continue (because of family and work) so I share what I have developped during some weeks. Texts are in french but it's very easy to change it. Contributions are welcomed.
